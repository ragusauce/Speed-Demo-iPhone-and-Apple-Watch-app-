# Speed-Demo-iPhone-and-Apple-Watch-app-

*This app is not intended to be used as an everyday, practical app.  It was created for the sole purpose of demonstrating some of the Apple Watch's technologies and how to implement them.  Of course, these implementations can be used as a foundation for more functional applications.*

This app demonstrates the CoreLocation and Watch Connectivity features of the Apple Watch.  The watch app tracks the current speed of the watch and sends that data over to the iPhone counterpart app.  An alert on the phone goes off when the watch reaches a certain speed, which can be configured by the user on the phone app.

To use the app, first launch the watch companion app.  Use the start/stop button to track the watch's current speed.  On the iPhone app, you can view the watch's speed and use the slider to change the speed at which the alert on the phone will be set off.
